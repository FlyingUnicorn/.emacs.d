--- Registers ---
- each register has a name that consists for a single character (a != A)
- registers are for quick access to things e.g. piece of text, a rectange, a number, a file, a window config.
-- Save window config --

C-x r j REG		- jumo to register REG
-- Save test --
(good for storing text when you do not want to change the kill-ring
C-x r s REG		- copy region into REG
C-x r i REG		- insert text from REG
-- Save position --
C-x r <SPC> REG		- record the position of the point and the current buffer into REG
C-x r j REG 		- jump to the posion and buffer saved in REG (will reopen buffer if killed)
-- Save numbers --
(use text if you want to copy)
C-u number C-x r n REG	- store number into reg
C-u number C-x r + REG	- if REG contains a number, increment the number in that register with number
C-x r i REG    	   	- insert number from REG

}			- prev. file
